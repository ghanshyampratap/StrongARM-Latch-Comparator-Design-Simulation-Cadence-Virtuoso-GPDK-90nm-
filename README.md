# ⚡ StrongARM Latch Comparator – Design & Simulation (Cadence Virtuoso | GPDK 90nm)

## 📘 INTRODUCTION
A StrongARM latch is a high-speed dynamic comparator widely used in ADCs and mixed-signal ICs. It offers:

- Zero static power consumption  
- High gain and fast regeneration  
- Differential input comparison  
- Clock-controlled dynamic operation  

The comparator operates in two phases:

1. **Precharge Phase (CLK = 0):** Outputs precharged to VDD  
2. **Evaluation Phase (CLK = 1):** Regenerative comparison begins through the differential pair  

This project involves designing and simulating the StrongARM latch in **Cadence Virtuoso** using **GPDK 90nm** technology with transient analysis using Spectre.

## ⚙️ WORKING

### Components
- **M1–M2:** Differential NMOS input pair  
- **M3–M6:** Cross-coupled PMOS–NMOS regenerative latch  
- **M7:** Tail NMOS (clock-controlled)  
- **M8–M9:** PMOS precharge devices
  
### 🔄 Operation
- **CLK = 0 (Precharge Phase):**  
  Outputs Out+ and Out− charged to VDD, tail NMOS OFF  

- **CLK = 1 (Evaluation Phase):**  
  Tail NMOS ON, differential pair discharges nodes based on Vin+ and Vin−  
  Positive feedback regenerates decision to logic levels

## 🔋 LOW POWER TECHNIQUE (Isolation Transistors)
In the standard StrongARM latch, a momentary direct path from VDD → GND causes **short-circuit dynamic power**.

To reduce this, **isolation transistors** are added:

### Fig 3 – With Isolation Transistors

### Fig 4 – Without Isolation Transistors

Benefits of isolation transistors:
- Reduce short-circuit current  
- Avoid direct VDD→GND conduction  
- Maintain speed while lowering power

## RESULTS AND OUTPUT ANALYSIS

### Precharge Phase (CLK = 0)
- Tail OFF  
- Out+ and Out− ≈ VDD  
- Zero static power  

### Evaluation Phase (CLK = 1)
- Tail ON  
- Input difference decides discharge rate  
- Regenerative feedback amplifies to full swing  

The output correctly shows:
- Logic high when **V+ > V−**  
- Logic low when **V− > V+**
